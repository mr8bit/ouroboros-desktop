"""Ouroboros — Frozen PluginAPI contract (v1, Phase 4).

Every ``type: extension`` skill's ``plugin.py`` module exports a single
entry point::

    def register(api: PluginAPI) -> None:
        api.register_tool(...)
        api.register_route(...)
        api.register_ws_handler(...)

``PluginAPI`` is the ONLY surface an extension may call. The ABI
declared here is frozen between releases in the same sense as
``ouroboros/contracts/tool_abi.py`` — breaking any method signature or
tightening a permission allowlist requires a deliberate bump in
``SKILL_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION`` and a release note in
``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` §12.

The surface intentionally mirrors what the Phase 3 plan approved:

- ``register_tool``      — add a tool callable via the normal tool
                           dispatch surface, namespaced as
                           ``ext_<len>_<token>_<name>``.
- ``register_route``     — register an HTTP handler mounted under
                           ``/api/extensions/<skill>/<path>``.
- ``register_ws_handler``— attach a handler for WS message types
                           namespaced the same provider-safe way.
- ``register_ui_tab``    — declare a reviewed Widgets-page surface.
- ``log``                — structured logger (the extension does not
                           touch ``logging``/``print`` directly).
- ``get_settings``       — read-only view of settings keys the skill's
                           manifest ``env_from_settings`` allowlist
                           permits AND the extension-safe denylist does
                           not block.

All registrations are declarative — an extension that is later disabled
via ``toggle_skill`` is reloaded with all of its registrations torn
down, so the extension layer has no persistent side effects beyond the
skill's own state directory.
